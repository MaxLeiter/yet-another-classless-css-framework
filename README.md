# Yet Another Classless CSS Framework

This is the CSS framework that I use as a basis for my personal sites and side-projects.

It focuses on semantic HTML, a light footprint, and using no classes, so you can drag-and-drop it into your project without a second thought.

You can find a demo of most elements on https://yet-another-css-framework.maxleiter.com.
